# logic-gate-simulator
Logic Gate Simulator is a simple web-based educational tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to explore the basic logic gates — AND, OR, XOR, and NOT — by selecting binary inputs and visualizing the output in real time.

This project was created to demonstrate fundamental concepts of Boolean logic and digital circuits in an interactive way.

Features:
Interactive interface for binary inputs (0 and 1)
Real-time output display
Supports AND, OR, XOR, and NOT gates
Clean and responsive design

Technologies:
HTML | CSS | JavaScript
